# Comments

In Lua, there are two ways to write comments:

1. Single-line comments

You can write single-line comments by starting the line with `--`. Anything after `--` will be ignored by the Lua interpreter.

```lua
-- This is a single-line comment
print("Hello, world!") -- This is another single-line comment
```

2. Multi-line comments

You can write multi-line comments by enclosing the text within `--[[` and `]]`.

```lua
--[[
This is a multi-line comment.
It can span multiple lines.
]]
print("Hello, world!")
```

## Task 1: Modify the application to uncomment the `print` statement

<LuaTest
  defaultValue={
    '-- Task 1: Modify the application to uncomment the `print` statement.\n-- print("The code has been uncommented!")'
  }
  printValidator={(str) => str === "The code has been uncommented!"}
/>

## Task 2: Modify the application to uncomment the `print` statement

<LuaTest
  defaultValue={
    '-- Task 2: Modify the application to uncomment the `print` statement.\n--[[\nprint("The code has been uncommented!")\n]]'
  }
  printValidator={(str) => str === "The code has been uncommented!"}
/>

## Task 3: Modify the application to comment the `print` statement

<LuaTest
  defaultValue={
    '-- Task 3: Modify the application to comment the `print` statement.\nprint("Don\'t comment me!")\nprint("Comment me please!")'
  }
  printValidator={(str) => str === "Don't comment me!"}
/>

### Tip

You can use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd> to comment or uncomment a line in most code editors, including the one used in Codecho!
