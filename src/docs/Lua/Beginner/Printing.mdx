# Printing things to the console

Let's get started with some actual coding!

To start with, we will try to use the `print()` function to print something to the console.

## Example 1: Printing "Hi!" to the console

In this example, we will write a Lua program that will print "Hi!" to the console.

```lua
print("Hi!")
```

The parentheses indicate that we want to call a function.

The quotation marks indicate that we are writing a string. For more information on strings, refer to [here]().

```
â†’ Hi!
```

As you can see, "Hi!" is printed to the console! How cool, right?

## Task 1: Modify the application to print "Hello, world!" to the console

<LuaTest
  defaultValue={
    '-- Task 1: Modify the application to print `Hello, world!` to the console.\nprint("Hi!")'
  }
  printValidator={(str) => str === "Hello, world!"}
/>

## Task 2: Create an application that prints "I am learning Lua!" to the console

<LuaTest
  defaultValue={
    '-- Task 2: Create an application that prints `I am learning Lua!` to the console.\n'
  }
  printValidator={(str) => str === "I am learning Lua!"}
/>
